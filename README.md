This project represents the last part of my training as a junior web developer. I created the frontend and the backend.

Instructions
Backend:
* install all depedencies : npm install
* create the empty mysql tables. Choose their name and put it un /backend/config/config.json (choose the passwords too ;) )
* create the tables : sequelize db:create
* Migrate the tables : sequelize db:migrate
* nodemon server ( or node server)

Development in progress ...
